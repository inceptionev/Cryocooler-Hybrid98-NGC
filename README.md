These are 3d-printable parts for supporting the use of STI Hybrid 98 Cryocoolers.  These were amazing pieces of engineering used to provide the low operating temperatures required for superconducting rf filters in, among other things, cell towers.  High temperature supercondutors were discovered in 1986, and within 12 years we were using them to make cellphone calls.

These have been designed around the model with three mounting tabs protruding radially from the body of the cooler, rather than the type that has a 360-degree flange.  A design for the flange-type may be coming in the future.

3D models are provided in Inventor .ipt format and 3d-printable .stl format.

STI Hybrid Cryocooler.ipt is the model of the cryocooler itself.  Provided in .ipt, .stl, and .step.

STI Hybrid Cooling Shroud.ipt is designed to be used with an Orion OAB800 blower to provide cooling for both the hot-end and the solenoid driver.  You will need both M3 (for the cryocooler) and M4 (for the blower) heat-set inserts.  This has 2 sub-parts:
- STI Hybrid 98 Cooling Shroud.stl
- STI Hybrid 98 Cooling Shroud - Gasket.stl  A .dxf file is also provided for laser-cutting.

STI Hybrid 98 Cryocooler Assembly.iam shows how it all goes together

BlowerPowerEntry.ipt: If you want to provide a mount for a power entry module that uses a Schurter 6160.0012 C8 connector for a power cord to the blower, you can use this.  It bolts on to one of the blower mounting holes.

LN2-Dish-SuperconductingSolenoid.ipt is a dish that allows a ring of superconducting wire to be suspended in such a way that a magnet can be passed through the plane of the loop to recreate Gerrit Flim's 1932 demonstration of persistent current at the Royal Institution.  There are 3 sub-parts:
- LN2-Dish-SuperconductingSolenoid.stl
- LN2-Dish-SuperconductingSolenoid-Stand.stl
- LN2-Dish-SuperconductingSolenoid-RibbonClamp.stl: This clamps superconductor wire or ribbon together to provide conductivity without soldering or crimping
